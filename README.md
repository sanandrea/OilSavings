OilSavings
=
This is an iPhone app written in objective c that allows users to find the nearest and cheapest Gas Stations around them in order to optimize the trip and save on re-fueling. The app needs a remote service in order to get the location and prices of the Gas Stations. The app also optimizes the trip by considering the real route to go to the gas stations not just the straight line between two points. 

Moreover the user is able to choose from a rich DB of car models that provide the optimizing algorithm with fuel consumption rates.

The folder showcase contains some screenshots. Unfortunately they are only in Italian!
